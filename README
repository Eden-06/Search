Search is a Java based framework for problem solving through searching. 
It's inspired by the Lecture 'Grundlagen der k√ºnstlichen Intelligenz'
and is based on Algorithms introduced in the Book 
'Artificial Intelligence - A modern Approach' by Stuart J. Russell, Peter Norvig et al.

This framework is applicable to a multitude of different problem classes.
In order to allow User's to get insight into different search algorithms,
we included an extensive documentation and several examples about commen problems.

The overall architecture is seperated into three layers core, basic and extended.
